### The Taler Rewards Program:

Our unique Taler Rewards Program provides an exciting opportunity to enhance your experience on **Skriza**. As a user, you can earn Talers by actively participating and contributing to the community. Each of your posts is automatically assigned a sentiment value, based on our own advanced algorithms, that helps foster a constructive and positive atmosphere throughout the entire community.

Talers can be spent both on our platform for extra visibility of your posts and with our external partners for vouchers. If you're interested in a partnership, please contact us at [contact@skriza.com](mailto:contact@skriza.com).

The full guidelines and details of the Taler Rewards Program can be viewed on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/U6y3B9ncS8).
